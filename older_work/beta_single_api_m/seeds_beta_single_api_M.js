                    "This planet has been known to humanity since ancient times and although its discovery date is unknown, the first mentions of the planet are believed to be around 3000 BC by the Sumerians.",

                    "A year on this planet is 88 days, yet a day is 176 of our days. This planet is also nearly tidally locked to the Sun – also known as a gravitational lock – and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun.",

                    "Not only is this planet the smallest planet, it is also shrinking. In a very, very slow process, it is getting smaller every day. It is estimated that the planet is about 9 miles smaller than it was four billion years ago(we told you it was a slow process). Astronomers believe this is happening because it’s iron core is cooling, which is making it solid, therefore reducing the planet’s volume.",

                    "This planet is the smallest planet in the solar system with a diameter of 4879 km and is one of five planets that is visible to the naked eye.",

                    "This planet is the second densest planet. Despite its small size, it is very dense because it is composed mainly of heavy metals and rock – the main characteristic of terrestrial planets.",

                    "This planet is named after the messenger of the Roman gods, who is also known as Hermes in Greek mythology.This is because of the speed in which this planet orbits the Sun and the speed with which the Roman deity was able to deliver messages.",

                    "Modern astronomers didn’t consider that this planet to be a planet at all until 1543 when Copernicus published his Sun-centered model of the Solar System, which put the Sun as the centre of the solar system rather than the previously believed centre, our home planet.",

                    "The planet has just 38% of the gravity on our home planet. This means that it isn’t able to hold the atmosphere it has and it instead gets blown away by solar winds. However those same solar winds are also bringing in new gases, radioactive decay and dust from micrometeorites which replenishes the atmosphere.",

                    "This planet has no moons or rings because of it's low gravity and lack of consistent atmosphere. The only other planet with no moons is Venus.",

                    "It was once believed that a planet called Vulcan existed between the orbit of this planet and the Sun – however the existence of such a planet was never found. This is where the idea for the planet Vulcan in Star Trek comes from,",

                    "The orbit of this planet is an ellipse rather than circular. It has the most eccentric orbit in the solar system and the least circular of all of the planets, according to scientists and astronomers.",

                    "This planet is only the second hottest planet. It's nearest neighbor, though farther from the Sun than it, actually experiences higher temperatures. This is because this planet has no atmosphere to regulate temperature and results in the most extreme temperature change of all the planets, ranging from -170°C(-280°F) during the night to 430°C(800°F) during the day.",

                    "This planet does not experience any seasons. The axis of this planet has the smallest tilt of all other planets, and this results in a lack of seasons on its surface.",

                    "This planet is the only planet which doesn’t rotate exactly once every year, instead rotating three times for every two orbits of the Sun. This is because it is nearly tidally locked to the Sun.",

                    "The orbit of this planet was important in proving Albert Einstein’s theory of General Relativity and is referenced in several of the physicists studies and mathematical arguments as cosmic proof of relativity in action, due to its orbit, speed and more complex mathematical truths.",

                    "This planet is sometimes referred to as the “morning star” and “evening star”. When the orbit of this planet overtakes Earth’s orbit, it changes from being visible at sunrise to being visible at sunset.They were known as Phosphorus and Hesperus by the Greeks, and Lucifer and Vesper by the Romans.",

                    "One day on this planet is longer than one year. Due to the slow rotation on its axis, it takes 243 Earth-days to complete one rotation. The orbit of the planet takes 225 of our days – making a year on this planet shorter on day on this planet.",

                    "This planet is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. This may be, in part, due the brightness of the planet and may date back to the Babylonians in 1581 who referred to this planet as 'bright queen of the sky'.",

                    "In spite of this planet being known as the sister planet to our planet, it is also considered one of the most hostile planets with regards to compatibility for Earth life. This is due to an incredibly hot surface, poisonous gases in the atmosphere and the incredible atmospheric pressure.",

                    "Billions of years ago, the climate of this planet may been similar to that of ours and scientists believe that this planet once possessed large amounts of water or oceans. However, due to the high temperatures produce from the extreme greenhouse effect, this water boiled off long ago.",

                    "This plane rotate in the opposite direction to other planets. Most other planets rotate counter-clockwise on their axis. However this planet, like one other planet much further out from the sun, rotates clockwise. This is known as a retrograde rotation and may have been caused by a collision with an asteroid or other object which caused the planet to change its rotational path.",

                    "This planet is the hottest planet in the solar system with an average surface temperature of 462°C (863°F). Also, this planet doesn’t tilt on its axis which means there are no seasons either. The atmosphere is a dense 96.5% carbon dioxide which traps heat and caused the greenhouse effect which evaporated any water sources billions of years ago.",

                    "The temperature on this planet doesn’t vary much between the night and day, remaining very high constantly. This is due to the slow movement of the solar winds across the surface of the planet.",

                    "The estimated age of this planets surface is around 300-400 million years old. By comparison, the surface of our home is about 100 million years old. For this reason, this planet is sometimes called a potential, tragic, future for our planet",

                    "The atmospheric pressure of this planet is 92 times stronger than our planet. This means that any small asteroids entering the atmosphere of Venus are crushed by the immense pressure, which is why there are no small surface craters on the planet. This pressure is equivalent to being around 1,000 km under our planets oceans.",

                    "This planet has a very weak magnetic field. This surprised scientists, who expected this planet to have a magnetic field similar in strength to our planet. One possible reason for this is that this planet has no solid inner core, or that its core is not cooling.",

By contrast, this planets surface gravity is only 37% of the our home planets (meaning you could leap nearly three times higher here).",

As of September 2014 there have been 40 missions to this planet, including orbiters, landers and rovers but not counting flybys.The most important missions include the Curiosity missions (begun in 2012), the MAVEN mission, which arrived on September 22, 2014, followed by the Indian Space Research Organization’s MOM Mangalyaan orbiter, which arrived on September 24, 2014 and the NASA’s InSight robotic lander mission in September, 2016.",

At the closest point to the Sun, this planets southern hemisphere leans towards the Sun, causing a short, intensely hot summer, while the northern hemisphere endures a brief, cold winter: at its farthest point from the Sun, the northern hemisphere leans towards the Sun, causing a long, mild summer, while the southern hemisphere endures a lengthy, cold winter.",

Scientists have found tiny traces of this planets atmosphere within meteorites which orbited the solar system amongst galactic debris for millions of years before crash landing on our home planet. This allowed scientists to begin studying this planet prior to launching space missions.",

The ancient Greeks called the planet Ares, after their god of war; the Romans then did likewise, associating the planet’s blood- red colour with their own god of war. Interestingly, other ancient cultures also focused on colour – to China’s astronomers it was ‘the fire star’, whilst Egyptian priests called on ‘Her Desher’, or ‘the red one’.The red colour this planet is known for is due to the rock and dust covering its surface being rich in iron.",

The first signs of trickling water are dark stripes or stains on crater wall and cliffs seen in satellite images.Due to this planets atmosphere this water would have to be salty to prevent it from freezing or vaporizing.",

It is also the sixth-largest moon in the Solar System.

It has a very thin atmosphere, composed primarily of oxygen. Its surface is striated by cracks and streaks, but craters are relatively few. In addition to Earth-bound telescope observations, Europa has been examined by a succession of space-probe flybys, the first occurring in the early 1970s.",

                            "Ganymede is a satellite of Jupiter (Jupiter III) and is the largest and most massive of the Solar System's moons. The ninth-largest object in the Solar System, it is the largest without a substantial atmosphere. It has a diameter of 5,268 km (3,273 mi), making it 26% larger than the planet Mercury by volume, although it is only 45% as massive. Possessing a metallic core, it has the lowest moment of inertia factor of any solid body in the Solar System and is the only moon known to have a magnetic field. Outward from Jupiter, it is the seventh satellite and the third of the Galilean moons, the first group of objects discovered orbiting another planet. Ganymede orbits Jupiter in roughly seven days and is in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance with the moons Europa and Io, respectively.",

                            "Ganymede is composed of approximately equal amounts of silicate rock and water. It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich, liquid core, and an internal ocean that may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. Its surface is composed of two main types of terrain. Dark regions, saturated with impact craters and dated to four billion years ago, cover about a third of it. Lighter regions, crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges and only slightly less ancient, cover the remainder. The cause of the light terrain's disrupted geology is not fully known, but was likely the result of tectonic activity due to tidal heating.",

                            "The Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) had a proposed launch date in 2020, and was a joint NASA and ESA proposal for exploration of many of Jupiter's moons including Ganymede. In February 2009 it was announced that ESA and NASA had given this mission priority ahead of the Titan Saturn System Mission. EJSM consisted of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter, the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter, and possibly a JAXA-led Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter. ESA's contribution faced funding competition from other ESA projects but on May 2, 2012 the European part of the mission, renamed Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), obtained a L1 launch slot in 2022 with an Ariane 5 in the ESA's Cosmic Vision science programme. The spacecraft will orbit Ganymede and conduct multiple flyby investigations of Callisto and Europa.",

                            "Mimas's most distinctive feature is a giant impact crater 130 km (81 mi) across, named Herschel after the discoverer of Mimas. Herschel's diameter is almost a third of Mimas's own diameter; its walls are approximately 5 km (3 mi) high, parts of its floor measure 10 km (6 mi) deep, and its central peak rises 6 km (4 mi) above the crater floor.

It was discovered by Gerard Kuiper on 16 February 1948 at McDonald Observatory in Texas, and named after Miranda from William Shakespeare's play The Tempest. Like the other large moons of Uranus, Miranda orbits close to its planet's equatorial plane. Because Uranus orbits the Sun on its side, Miranda's orbit is perpendicular to the ecliptic and shares Uranus' extreme seasonal cycle.",

                            "At just 470 km in diameter, Miranda is one of the smallest closely observed objects in the Solar System that might be in hydrostatic equilibrium (spherical under its own gravity). The only close-up images of Miranda are from the Voyager 2 probe, which made observations of Miranda during its Uranus flyby in January 1986. During the flyby, Miranda's southern hemisphere pointed towards the Sun, so only that part was studied.",

                            "While crater counts suggest that the majority of Miranda's surface is old, with a similar geological history to the other Uranian satellites, few of those craters are particularly large, indicating that most must have formed after a major resurfacing event in its distant past. Craters on Miranda also appear to possess softened edges, which could be the result either of ejecta or of cryovolcanism. The temperature at Miranda's south pole is roughly 85K, a temperature at which pure water ice adopts the properties of rock",

The origin of the carbon dioxide is not completely clear. It might be produced locally from carbonates or organic materials under the influence of the energetic charged particles coming from Uranus's magnetosphere or solar ultraviolet radiation. ",

It was discovered at the same time as Ariel and named after a character in Alexander Pope's poem The Rape of the Lock. Umbriel consists mainly of ice with a substantial fraction of rock, and may be differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. The surface is the darkest among Uranian moons, and appears to have been shaped primarily by impacts. However, the presence of canyons suggests early endogenic processes, and the moon may have undergone an early endogenically driven resurfacing event that obliterated its older surface.",

The most prominent surface feature is a ring of bright material on the floor of Wunda crater. This moon, like all moons of Uranus, probably formed from an accretion disk that surrounded the planet just after its formation.",

The pressure in the center of Umbriel is about 0.24 GPa (2.4 kbar). The current state of the icy mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.",

Like the other gas giants, it has a hydrogen upper layer, which has helium mixed in.Below that is an icy “mantle, which surrounds a rock and ice core.The upper atmosphere is made of water, ammonia and the methane ice crystals that give the planet its pale blue colour.",

The ring particles are small, ranging from a dust- sized particles to small boulders.There are eleven inner rings and two outer rings.They probably formed when one or more of Uranus’s moons were broken up in an impact.The first rings were discovered in 1977 with the two outer rings being discovered in Hubble Space Telescope images between 2003 and 2005.",

With a mean density of 1.27 g/cm3, Uranus has the second-lowest density of any planet in the Solar System.",

Unfortunately, you’d need to make sure that the night sky was extremely dark (i.e. no light pollution), and would have to know exactly where to look.",

                    "The possibility of sending the Cassini spacecraft from Saturn to Uranus was evaluated during a mission extension planning phase in 2009. However, this never came to fruition, as it would have taken about twenty years for Cassini to get to the Uranian system after departing Saturn.",

In 2014, between Uranus's infrequent equinoxes, astronomers using the 10-meter Keck telescope spotted eight stunning squalls below its blue blanket. Scientists suggest that perhaps these vortices are rooted deeper in the atmosphere, like the storms of Jupiter. But to know for sure, researchers would need a closer look.",

                    "Like Saturn, Jupiter, and Neptune, Uranus is a big ball of gas, often called a jovian or gas giant world. Uranus owes its vibrant blue-green hues not from unusual oceans but from an upper atmosphere flush with methane, which absorbs the sun's red light and scatters blue light back to our eyes. The rest of planet's atmosphere is largely made of hydrogen and helium, with scant amounts of ammonia, water, and methane. Trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide also hint that, if you could visit this distant place without a spacesuit, the planet would smell like rotten eggs. ",

Until the discovery of the second moon Nereid in 1949, Triton was commonly referred to as 'the satellite of Neptune'. Lassell did not name his own discovery; he later successfully suggested the name Hyperion, previously chosen by John Herschel, for the eighth moon of Saturn when he discovered it",

He proposed the name in the report of his discovery. It is named after the Nereids, sea-nymphs of Greek mythology and attendants of the god Neptune. It was the second and last moon of Neptune to be discovered before the arrival of Voyager 2 (not counting a single observation of an occultation by Larissa in 1981).",

Its spectrum appears to be intermediate between Uranus's moons Titania and Umbriel, which suggests that Nereid's surface is composed of a mixture of water ice and some spectrally neutral material. The spectrum is markedly different from minor planets of the outer solar system, centaurs Pholus, Chiron and Chariklo, suggesting that Nereid formed around Neptune rather than being a captured body.",

When Pluto elliptical orbit takes it closer to the Sun, its surface ice thaws and forms a thin atmosphere primarily of nitrogen which slowly escapes the planet.It also has a methane haze that overs about 161 kilometres above the surface.The methane is dissociated by sunlight into hydrocarbons that fall to the surface and coat the ice with a dark covering.When Pluto travels away from the Sun the atmosphere then freezes back to its solid state.",
                    
                    "In 2006, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet, a change widely thought of as a demotion. The question of Pluto's planet status has attracted controversy and stirred debate in the scientific community, and among the general public, since then. In 2017, a science group (including members of the New Horizon mission) proposed a new definition of planethood based on 'round objects in space smaller than stars,' which would make the number of planets in our solar system expand from 8 to roughly 100.",
                    
                    "Observations of Pluto's surface by the New Horizons spacecraft revealed a variety of surface features, including mountains that reach as high as 11,000 feet (3,500 meters), comparable to the Rocky Mountains on Earth. While methane and nitrogen ice cover much of the surface of Pluto, these materials are not strong enough to support such enormous peaks, so scientists suspect that the mountains are formed on a bedrock of water ice.",
                    
                    "Pluto's surface is also covered in an abundance of methane ice, but New Horizons scientists have observed significant differences in the way the ice reflects light across the dwarf planet's surface. The dwarf planet also possesses ice ridge terrain that appears to look like a snakeskin; astronomers spotted similar features to Earth's penitentes, or erosion-formed features on mountainous terrain. The Pluto features are much larger; they are estimated at 1,650 feet (500 m) tall, while the Earth features are only a few meters in size.",
                    
                    "Another distinct feature on Pluto's surface is a large heart-shaped region known unofficially as Tombaugh Regio (after Clyde Tombaugh; regio is Latin for region). The left side of the region (an area that takes on the shape of an ice cream cone) is covered in carbon monoxide ice. Other variations in the composition of surface materials have been identified within the 'heart' of Pluto.",
